This academic work is about a NN library to allow anyone to build different neural networks with different topologies and neurons in each layer. Futher this project will calculate many metrics to measure the quality of the neural network in the specific problem, also the project provides some files with real problems to experiment.

	Technology: Java.

In this directory we have different files :

- Net-mind_experiments : This directory contains all the experimental section of the work. Both the compiled files , manuals , experimental proben files , the results obtained. In short , everything that has to do with the experimental part. For more information read this README.txt file in the folder

- RNA : the workspace of eclipse where I developed the project contains all the source code set . This is designed so that you can load directly into eclipse, and contains all the two programs created for their job.

- Net- Mind : the memory of this work.

- Annex: contains the experimental data presented in the theoretical work Net- Mind .

I recommend reading the README.txt file in the net- mind_experiments folder before attempting to reproduce the experiments because the program that generates networks have many options , but specifically recommend using one that speeds up the job and that is explained in the file.
